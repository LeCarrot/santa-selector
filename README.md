# Santa Selector
Generate Secret Santa pairings digitally. 
Can't get together to physically draw names? 
Don't want to deal with the last person drawing themself and having to start all over?

## How it Works
This program takes in a list of names as the participents and outputs a file for each one. Each file containes the name of another participent. The user of this program can then send those files (without looking at their contents) to the participents to effectivly generate Secret Santa pairings with minimal hassle. 

## Installation
WIP (I'm sure you can figure it out)

## To-Do
The generation is cool and all, but it's still up the user to deliver the files to each participent. I want to add other output possibilities that would allow this application to send results direclty to each participent, without the generator ever having a chance to peek. Or, at least some integration options with other common tools.
